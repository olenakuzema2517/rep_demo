Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancin'
But she's dancin' with another man
